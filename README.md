Descriptive and Inferential Analysis of Different Video Codecs Streaming Dataset

Abstract

The ever-growing online video streaming is a concern for the environment. This study is a designed experiment to investigate and compare the energy consumption, compression efficiency and environmental impacts of AV1, VP9, H.264 and HEVC codecs used for video streaming. 
The use stage of ITU-T for ICT services in LCA methodology will be used in this experiment. The experiment consists of collecting data of streaming a sample video with the four different coding, ten times each, analysing the energy consumption results using data mining approaches, and transforming the power data to GHG emissions by using Defra factors.
	As a result, HEVC was the greenest codec regarding video streaming, while VP9 showed the best compression rate, which will cause a lower need for storage and bandwidth.
